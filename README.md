# Cosine-Calculator
Calculating Cos(x) using Taylor expansion series (Digital Logic Design)

The input is represented by a 16-bit fixed point number with 8 bits of integer and 8 bits
of fractional parts. The output is a fixed point fractional number. Data inputs range between 0 and 2Ï€.
Based on the required precision, intermediate values can be truncated. Multiplication
results that produce 32 bit results can be reduced to 16 bits.
